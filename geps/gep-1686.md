# GEP-1686: Mesh conformance testing plan

- Issue: [#1686](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1686)
- Status: Provisional

## Goals

Create a test suite for testing implementations of the GAMMA spec for conformance as laid out by the GAMMA GEPs. The Gateway API project defines “conformance levels” for implementations. Each level of conformance expands on the previous. How exactly conformance looks for GAMMA is being explored in [gateway-api#1488](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1488).
It’s likely that GAMMA conformance will be encapsulated in a “Mesh” [conformance profile](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1709).

GAMMA should expand on the existing Gateway API suite of conformance tests for implementations for verifying conformance.

## Focus

Currently the GAMMA spec consists of two Gateway API GEPs [defining terminology and goals of Gateway API for service meshes](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1324/)
and specifically [how route resources work in a service mesh
context](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1426/).
The goal of the initial conformance testing is to check the essential behavior as defined by GEP-1426, as it differs from the wider Gateway API spec. This GEP focuses on using a `Service` object as an `xRoute` `parentRef` to control how the GAMMA implementation directs traffic to the endpoints specified by the `Services` in `backendRefs` and how the traffic is filtered and modified.

## Tests

Testing GAMMA implementations requires both a new suite of test cases as well as refactoring the existing test framework setup.

### Runner and Setup

The existing Gateway API conformance tests use a relatively simple implementation to send requests from outside a Kubernetes cluster to a gateway sitting at the edge, [capture the request and response](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/conformance/utils/roundtripper/roundtripper.go), and [assert a match against an expected response](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/blob/main/conformance/utils/http/http.go).

GAMMA conformance tests should still be based around a request/expected response suite, but requests will need to originate from _inside the cluster_, from either the same or different namespace as the target service. Adopting or developing tooling to enable this is being explored in [gateway-api#1340](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1340).

### Scenarios

All requests are sent from a client inside the same cluster/mesh and the same `Namespace`
as the `Service` under test.
Test scenarios are largely focused on the `backendRefs` and the
`Namespace` of an `xRoute` resource.

#### `Service` as `parentRef`

- Given a simple `HTTPRoute` with a single `backendRef`
  - With an explicit `port` in `parentRef`
    - Assert that only requests to this `Service` and `port` are directed to the
      backend
  - Without a `port` in `parentRef`
    - Assert that all requests to this `Service` are directed to the backend

#### Omitted `backendRefs`

- Given a simple `HTTPRoute` without `backendRefs`
  - Assert that requests are directed to the endpoints defined by the `Service`
    `parentRef` in its backend role

#### Only `Services` as frontends are affected

- Given a simple `HTTPRoute` with a single `backendRef`
  - Send requests directly the endpoints of the `parentRef` `Service`'s backend
  - Assert that traffic is not affected by the `HTTPRoute` resource

#### `Namespace`-dependent behavior, producer vs consumer

A producer `HTTPRoute` is in the same namespace as the `parentRef` `Service` (the
producer).

- Given a producer `HTTPRoute`
  - Assert that traffic from a client in the producer `Namespace` is routed by the
    `HTTPRoute`
  - Assert that traffic from a client in a different `Namespace` is routed by the
    `HTTPRoute`

A consumer `HTTPRoute` is in the same `Namespace` as the the request sender (the
consumer), a different `Namespace` as the `parentRef` `Service`.

- Given a consumer `HTTPRoute`
  - Assert that traffic from the consumer client is routed by the `HTTPRoute`
  - Assert that traffic from a client in a different `Namespace` is _not_ routed by the
    `HTTPRoute`

Consumer routes have priority over producer routes.

- Given both a consumer `HTTPRoute` and a producer `HTTPRoute`
  - Assert that traffic from the consumer client is routed by the consumer `HTTPRoute`
  - Assert that traffic from a client in a different `Namespace` is routed by
    the producer `HTTPRoute`

#### `xRoute`-specific

- Given multiple `xRoutes` of different types
  - Assert that routes take affect according to the specificity as defined in the spec
- Given an `HTTPRoute` without `matches`, all requests are received at the `Service` endpoints as if no `HTTPRoute` existed
- Given an `HTTPRoute` with `matches`, unmatched requests are dropped with a 404

#### Filters

Filters have the same effects on requests as any implementation. Gateway API conformance test framework can be
refactored to extract checks on filter behavior for use on both GAMMA and Gateway API tests.
