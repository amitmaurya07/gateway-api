# API Concepts

This document is a deep dive into the reasoning and design for the API. The
content of this document is taken from the [API sketch][api-sketch]. 

> We will try to keep the two documents in sync as the sketch document has to

## Roles and personas

In the original design of Kubernetes, the Ingress and Service resources were
based on a self-service model of usage; developers who create Services and
Ingresses control all aspects of defining and exposing their applications to
their users. 

We have found that the self-service model does not fully capture some of the
more complex deployment and team structures that our users are seeing. The
Gateway/Routes API will target the following personas:

* **Infrastructure provider**: The infrastructure provider (infra) is
  responsible for the overall environment that the cluster(s) are operating in.
  Examples include: the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, ...), the PaaS provider
  in a company.
* **Cluster operator**: The cluster operator (ops) is responsible for
  administration of entire clusters. They manage policies, network access,
  application permissions.
* **Application developer**: The application developer (dev) is responsible for
  defining their application configuration (e.g. timeouts, request
  matching/filter) and Service composition (e.g. path routing to backends).

We expect that each persona will map approximately to a `Role` in the Kubernetes
Role-Based Authentication (RBAC) system and will define resource model
responsibility and separation.

Depending on the environment, multiple roles can map to the same user.
For example, giving the user all of the above role replicates the self-service
model.

## Resource model

> Note: Resource will initially live in the `networking.x-k8s.io` API group as
> Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Unqualified resource names will implicitly
> be assumed to be part of this API group.

Our resource model is based around a separation of concerns for a service
producer. Each resource is intended to be (mostly) independently-evolvable and self-consistent:

* A way to group pods (backends) into a set via label selection: Kubernetes
  `core.Service`, independent of application-level routing.
* A way to describe application-level routing: `xxxxRoute`, e.g. `HTTPRoute`,
  `TCPRoute` independent of traffic access and consumption (e.g.
* A way to describe traffic access and consumption: `Gateway` independent of
  implementation.
* A way to describe which implementations of traffic access are available:
  `GatewayClass`.

The combination of `GatewayClass`, `Gateway`, `xxxxRoute` and `Service`(s) will
define an implementable load-balancer. The diagram below illustrates the
relationships between the different resources:

### Design considerations

There are some general design guidelines used throughout this API.

#### Single resource consistency

The Kubernetes API guarantees consistency only on a single resource level. There
are a couple of consequences for complex resource graphs as opposed to single
resources:

* Error checking of properties spanning multiple resource will be asynchronous.
  Simple syntax checks will be possible at the single resource level, but cross
  resource dependencies will need to be handled by the controller.
* Controllers will need to handle broken links between resources and/or
  mismatched configuration.

#### Conflicts

Separation and delegation of responsibility among independent actors (e.g
between cluster ops and application developers) can result in conflicts in the
configuration. For example, two application teams may inadvertently submit
configuration for the same HTTP path. There are several different strategies for
handling this:

* TODO

#### Extensibility

TODO

### GatewayClass

`GatewayClass` is cluster-scoped resource defined by the infrastructure ops.
This resource represents a category of Gateways that can be instantiated.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: from-internet
controller:                          # links to a custom resource
  apiGroup: networking.acme.io       # that implements this class. 
  kind: cloud-lb
  name: from-internet
```

A sample controller file:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.acme.io/v1alpha1
kind: CloudLB
metadata:
  name: from-internet
networkTier: auto
ipAllocation: auto
```

We expect that one or more GatewayClasses will be created by the infrastructure
provider for the user as part of their cloud infrastructure. If the cluster
operator wishes to customize their `GatewayClasses`, they are free to do so,
interacting with the custom resource parameters. Example parameters
`GatewayClass.controller` resource will include cluster-level defaults and
constraints.

> The community may converge around a common set of GatewayClass names with
> well-known meanings (e.g. `internet`, `private`) to ease interoperability
> between platforms.

### Gateway

A `Gateway` is 1:1 with the life cycle of the configuration of LB
infrastructure. When a user creates a `Gateway`, a load balancer is provisioned
(see below for details) by the `GatewayClass` controller. `Gateway` is the
resource that triggers actions in this API. Other resources in this API are
configuration snippets until a Gateway has been created to link the resources
together.

The Gateway spec defines the following:

* GatewayClass used to instantiate this Gateway.
* Listener bindings, which define addresses and ports, protocol termination,
  TLS-settings. Listener configuration requested by a Gateway definition can be
  incompatible with a given GatewayClass (e.g. port/protocol combination is not
  supported)

. In this case, the Gateway will be in an error state, signalled by the status field.
Routes, which point to a set of protocol-specific routing served by the Gateway.
OPTIONAL: A Gateway can point directly to Kubernetes Service if no advanced routing is required.

#### Deployment models

Depending on the `GatewayClass`, the creation of the `Gateway` could do any of
the following actions:

* Use cloud APIs to create an LB instance.
* Spawn a new instance of a software LB (in this or another cluster).
* Add a configuration stanza to an already instantiated LB to handle the new
  routes.
* Program the SDN to implement the configuration.
* Something else we havenâ€™t thought of yet...

The API does not specify which one of these actions will be taken. Note that a
GatewayClass controller that manages in-cluster proxy processes MAY restrict
Gateway configuration scope, e.g. only be served in the same namespace.
