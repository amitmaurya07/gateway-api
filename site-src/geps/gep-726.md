# GEP-726: Add Path Redirects and Rewrites

* Issue: [#726](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/726)
* Status: Implementable

## TLDR

This GEP proposes adding support for path redirects and rewrites in addition to
host rewrites. This would augment the existing host redirection capabilities.

## Goals

* Implement path redirects.
* Implement the most portable and simple forms of path rewrites.
* Describe how more advanced rewrite and redirect and redirect capabilities
  could be added in the future.

## API

Although many implementations support very advanced rewrite and redirect
capabilities, the following are the most [portable](#portability) concepts that
are not already supported by the Gateway API:

* Path redirects
* Path prefix redirects
* Path prefix rewrites
* Host rewrites

Although regular expression based redirects and rewrites are commonly supported,
there is significantly more variation in both if and how they are implemented.
Given the wide support for this concept, it is important to design the API in a
way that would make it easy to add this capability in the future.

### Redirects

The existing `RequestRedirect` filter can be expanded to support path redirects.
In the following example, a request to `/foo/abc` would be redirected to
`/bar/abc`.

```yaml
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
metadata:
  name: http-filter-1
spec:
  rules:
    - matches:
      - path:
          type: Prefix
          value: /foo
      filters:
      - type: RequestRedirect
        requestRedirect:
          hostname: foo.com
          path:
            type: PathMatch
            value: /bar
```

This would be represented with the following API additions:
```go
// HTTPRequestRedirect defines a filter that redirects a request. At most one of
// these filters may be used on a Route rule. This may not be used on the same
// Route rule as a HTTPRequestRewrite filter.
type HTTPRequestRedirect struct {
  // Path defines a path redirect.
  //
  // Support: Extended
  //
  // +optional
  Path *HTTPPathRedirect `json:"path,omitempty"`
  // ...
}

// HTTPPathRedirectType defines the type of path redirect.
type HTTPPathRedirectType string

const (
  // This type of redirect indicates that the complete path will be replaced by
  // the path redirect value.
  AbsoluteHTTPPathRedirect HTTPPathRedirectType = "Absolute"

  // This type of redirect indicates that the path match will be replaced by
  // the path redirect value.
  PathMatchHTTPPathRedirect HTTPPathRedirectType = "PathMatch"
)

// HTTPPathRedirect defines configuration for path redirects.
type HTTPPathRedirect struct {
  // Type defines the type of path redirect.
  //
  // +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=Absolute;PathMatch
  Type HTTPPathRedirectType `json:"type"`

  // Value defines the HTTP path value to redirect to. An empty value ("")
  // indicates that the portion of the path to be changed in the redirect should
  // be removed from the redirect path. For example, a request to "/foo/bar"
  // with a prefix match of "/foo" would be redirected to "/bar".
  //
  // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=1024
  Value string `json:"value"`
}
```

### Rewrites

A new `RequestRewrite` filter can be added to support rewrites. In the following
example, a a request to `example.com/foo/abc` would be rewritten to
`example.net/bar/abc`.

```yaml
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
metadata:
  name: http-filter-1
spec:
  hostnames:
  - example.com
  rules:
    - matches:
      - path:
          type: Prefix
          value: /foo
      filters:
      - type: RequestRewrite
        requestRewrite:
          hostname: example.net
          path:
            type: ReplacePathMatch
            value: /bar
```

This would be represent with the following API additions:
```go
// HTTPRequestRewrite defines a filter that modifies a request during
// forwarding. At most one of these filters may be used on a Route rule. This
// may not be used on the same Route rule as a HTTPRequestRedirect filter.
type HTTPRequestRewrite struct {
  // Hostname is the value to be used to replace the Host header value during
  // forwarding.
  //
  // Support: Extended
  //
  // +optional
  // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=255
  Hostname *string `json:"hostname,omitempty"`

  // Path defines a path rewrite.
  //
  // Support: Extended
  //
  // +optional
  Path *HTTPPathRewrite `json:"path,omitempty"`
}

// HTTPPathRewriteType defines the type of path rewrite.
type HTTPPathRewriteType string

const (
  // This type of rewrite indicates that the prefix match will be replaced by
  // the path rewrite value.
  ReplacePathMatchHTTPPathRewrite HTTPPathRewriteType = "ReplacePathMatch"
)

// HTTPPathRewrite defines configuration for path rewrites.
type HTTPPathRewrite struct {
  // Type defines the type of path rewrite.
  //
  // +kubebuilder:validation:Enum=ReplacePathMatch
  Type HTTPPathRewriteType `json:"type"`

  // Value defines the HTTP path value to rewrite. An empty value ("") indicates
  // that the portion of the path to be rewritten should be removed from the
  // rewritten path. For example, a request to "/foo/bar" with a prefix match of
  // "/foo" would be rewritten to "/bar".
  //
  // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=1024
  Value string `json:"value"`
}
```

## Portability

When considering what should be possible in the API, it's worth evaluating what
common tooling is capable of. This is by no means a complete list, but this
provides a high level overview of how this is configured across different
implementations.

Although not all of these implementations directly support prefix rewrites or
redirects, the ones that don't include regular expression support which can be
used to implement prefix rewrites and redirects.

Note: This section intentionally excludes the redirect capabilities already
contained in the API.

### Envoy
Envoy supports the following relevant capabilities
([reference](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/route/v3/route_components.proto)):

* path_redirect (redirect only)
* prefix_rewrite (redirect and forwarding)
* regex_rewrite (redirect and forwarding)
* host_rewrite_literal (forwarding only)
* strip_query (redirect only)

Note that path rewrite relies on the prefix match for the route, there is not
a way to differentiate between the prefix used for matching and rewriting.

### Google Cloud
Google Cloud URL Maps support the following relevant capabilities
([reference](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/urlMaps)):

* pathPrefixRewrite (forwarding only)
* hostRewrite (forwarding only)
* pathRedirect (redirect only)
* prefixRedirect (redirect only)
* stripQuery (redirect only)

Note that path rewrite relies on the prefix match for the route, there is not
a way to differentiate between the prefix used for matching and rewriting.

### HAProxy
HAProxy supports the following relevant capabilities
([reference](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.5/configuration.html)):

* http-request set-path (advanced path rewrite capabilities)
* http-request replace-path (rewrites entire path)
* http-request replace-pathq (rewrites entire path + query string)
* http-request replace-uri (URI rewrite based on input regex)
* redirect location (advanced redirect capabilities)

### NGINX
The NGINX rewrite module contains the following relevant capabilities
([reference](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html)):

* PCRE regex based rewrites
* Rewrite directive can be used during forwarding or redirects
* Rewrite directive can affect host, path, or both
* Rewrite directive can be chained

## Alternatives

### 1. Top Level Rewrite Fields
Although a small difference, we could restructure how the path rewrites and
redirects were configured. One example would be adding top level fields in the
filters for each kind of path rewrite or redirect. That would result in a change
like this:

**Before:**
```yaml
requestRewrite:
  hostname: foo.com
  path:
    type: Prefix
    value: /bar
```

**After:**
```yaml
requestRewrite:
  hostname: foo.com
  pathPrefix: /bar
```

Although simpler for the initial use cases, it may become more difficult to
maintain and validate as additional types of rewrites and redirects were added.
