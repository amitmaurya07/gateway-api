# GEP-917: Gateway API conformance principles

* Issue: [#917](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/917)
* Status: Provisional

## TLDR

This GEP outlines the reasons for and principles by which the Gateway API will
design its conformance and testing regime.

## Goals

- Record why we are doing conformance and what we hope to achieve with it
- Record the success criteria for the conformance process and associated artifacts

## Non-Goals

- Designing the conformance process at anything more than a very basic level
- Designing the conformance testing framework or implementation
- Designing the process for implementations to prove they are conformant

## Introduction

### What is Conformance

Conformance is the creation of a process that allows everyone, implementors and
users alike, to check that an implementation conforms to the defined spec.

For core Kubernetes, this also allows for the use of specific badges and branding.

It usually includes some form of test harness that can produce a standard output,
which can be submitted somewhere for validation. The place where the validations
are held is then the canonical source of information about what implementations
are conformant.

### Why do it for Gateway API?
The Gateway API is a large, complex API with many use cases and implementations.
Not all implementations support the same features, and some features have
different required support levels.

One of the primary goals of the Gateway API project is to make it safer and
easier for end users to move their traffic configuration between implementations.
Without some form of conformance to guarantee the same behavior between
implementations, this is simply not achievable.

Possibly a better way to say this is that we are looking to have Route resources
portable between Gateways with a minimum of spec change.

By creating a standard set of conformance tests and information, we can:

- Make it easier for API consumers to understand what a particular API does
- Make it possible for tooling to be constructed to check for portability
between implementations

Additionally, as the first project to develop an "official" set of CRDs, we have
a responsibility to the community to build out a set of best practices for
similar efforts in the future. Ensuring that whatever we build is reusable for
other projects will help to lift everyone who works with CRDs.

### What do we need out of conformance for Gateway API?
Must have:

- Support for only implementing some of the Gateway API CRD resources. Some resources,
like Gateway itself, are required for all implementations, but implementations
may choose what Route resources they support. There will probably be some common
sets of Route resources supported across similar implementations, but this proposal
expects that we will make calls about what to call that common experience at a
later date.
- Support for fields or features that have Core, Extended, and
ImplementationSpecific support. In particular, it must be possible for
implementations to only support some subset of Extended fields, and to be able
to use the framework for their own ImplementationSpecific features if required.
- A testing suite that can validate that an implementation meets the conformance
profiles it claims.
- A way to retrieve conformance information in a machine-parseable way.

## Proposal

### Conformance profiles principles

#### Basics

The Gateway API project defines conformance purely in terms of what resources an
implementation supports.
To support a resource, an implementation must support all "Core" functionality
defined by the resource. Support for "Extended" functionality will be indicated
separately.

All implementations must support all the Core functions on the following resources:

- GatewayClass
- Gateway
- ReferencePolicy

The following resources are optional to support, but have defined behavior if you
do:

- HTTPRoute
- TLSRoute
- TCPRoute
- UDPRoute

For all of these resources, we should aim to have the usual range of tests for
both the happy and unhappy paths for various types of operations.

The conformance is versioned - it tracks the required features for a specific
version of the API, and must be included in and updated by a version bump in the
bundle version of the Gateway API. (The _bundle version_ is the thing that we
mark as a "release", that looks like `v0.4.0`, not `v1alpha2`). 

This will enable an implementation to say that it supports a specific version
of the Gateway API. This is again similar to upstream in that implementations need
to submit conformance test results for each version of Kubernetes they support.

Because the support is defined in terms of the resources that an implementation
supports, the conformance is composable, and orthogonal for each object type.
For example, it's valid to only support HTTPRoute and not TCPRoute, or TLSRoute
and not HTTPRoute.

#### Interaction with existing support levels

Conformance definitions will ensure that an implementation can provide all the
features currently marked as "Core" support in the API documentation.

Fields marked "Extended" support will eventually have conformance tests that
lock in the behavior of that feature, and there will be a mechanism for implementations
to tell the testing framework what extended fields they support.

#### Testing framework

The Gateway API project will provide a set of tests and harness to run them, such
that an implementation may point the test harness at a GatewayClass or individual
Gateway managed by that implementation and have the testing framework deliver a
report on if it meets the conformance standard. The report must be
machine-parsable.

There is a _lot_ of work to prepare this framework and introduce the initial
round of tests, let alone to have complete test coverage. Having a minimal set
of tests is a requirment for the API to graduate to `v1beta1` API stability level.
(As per our upstream KEP). It's acceptable to begin with a small set and expand
outward while the project is in beta, but having a full set of conformance tests
that cover most of the API scope should be a requirement for declaring the API
stable.

#### Certification process

The Gateway API project will provide a process by which an implementation may
submit the results of a run of the conformance test suite to a centralized,
open repository, and once verified, these results will be used to maintain a
canonical list of certified conformant implementations.

Ideally, this process should be handled using similar methods to upstream
Kubernetes, while also learning what we can from what the upstream conformance
efforts wish they could improve.


## Alternatives

There's no real alternative to having some form of conformance testing.
