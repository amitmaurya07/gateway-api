# Title

This is the title of the enhancement. Keep it simple and descriptive. A good
title can help communicate what the enhancement is and should be considered as
part of any review.

The title should be lowercased and spaces/punctuation should be replaced with
`-`.

To get started with this template:
1. **Make a copy of this template.** Copy this template into the enhancements
directory.
1. **Fill out the "overview" sections.** This includes the Summary and
   Motivation sections. These should be easy and explain why the community
   should desire this enhancement.
1. **Create a PR.** Assign it to folks with expertise in that domain to help
   sponsor the process.
1. **Merge at each milestone.** Merge when the design is able to transition to a
   new status (provisional, implementable, implemented, etc.). View anything
   marked as `provisional` as an idea worth exploring in the future, but not
   accepted as ready to execute. Anything marked as `implementable` should
   clearly communicate how an enhancement is implemented.

The `Metadata` section above is intended to support the creation of tooling
around the enhancement process.

## Release Signoff Checklist

- [ ] Enhancement is `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented from clear requirements
- [ ] Unit and e2e tests exist
- [ ] User-facing documentation is created

## Open Questions [optional]

This is where to call out areas of the design that require closure before deciding
to implement the design.

## Summary

A summary is important for producing high quality user-focused documentation
such as release notes or a development roadmap. It should be possible to collect
this information before implementation begins in order to avoid requiring
implementors to split their attention between writing release notes and
implementing the feature itself. 

## Motivation

This section is for explicitly listing the motivation, goals and non-goals of
the enhancement. Describe the benefits provided by the enhancement.

### Goals

List the specific goals of the proposal. What is the enhancement trying to achieve?

### Non-Goals

What is out of scope for this proposal? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussions.

## Design Details

This is where the details of the enhancement are covered.

### User Stories

Detail the things that people will be able to do if this is implemented.
Stories should be written from the viewpoint of a user [persona](concepts.md).

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

What are the caveats to the implementation? What are some important details that
didn't come across above. Go into as much detail as necessary here.

### Risks and Mitigations

What are the risks of this proposal and how should they be mitigated. Consider
how the enhancement will impact the project or the greater Kubernetes ecosystem.
For example, how will the enhancement be secure or what will the UX be like?

#### Examples [optional]

These are generalized examples to consider.

## Drawbacks

The idea is to find the best form of an argument why this enhancement should
_not_ be implemented.

## Alternatives

Highlight and record other possible approaches to deliver the value proposed
by the enhancement.
