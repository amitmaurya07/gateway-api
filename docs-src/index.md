# Introduction

Service APIs is an open source project, working under
[SIG-NETWORK][sig-network], that is evolving service networking APIs within
the Kubernetes ecosystem. Service APIs are the user interfaces you use to expose
your Kubernetes applications - Services, Ingress, and more. 

### What is the goal of Service APIs?

Service APIs aims to improve these interfaces by making them
more expressive, extensible, and role-oriented while remaining as
generic routing APIs that have many implementations and broad industry support. 

Service APIs are really a collection of API resources - `Service`,
`GatewayClass`, `Gateway`, `HTTPRoute`, `TCPRoute`, and so on. These resources
are used together to model a wide variety of different networking use-cases. See
[API Concepts](concepts.md) to learn more about the API model.

How do the Service APIs improve upon current standards like Ingress?

- **More expressive** - They express more core functionality for things like
header-based matching, traffic weighting, and other capabilities that were only
possible through custom means in the Ingress spec.    
- **More extensible** - They allow for custom resources to be linked at multiple
layers within its resources. This allows for more granular customization at the 
appropriate places within the API structure.    
- **Role oriented** - They are broken into API resources that map to the types  
of roles that commonly deploy and configure load balancing.    
- **Generic** - This isn't an improvement but rather something
that should stay the same. Just as Ingress is a universal specification with
[numerous implementations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/),
Service APIs are designed to be a portable specification for many
implementations.

Some other notable capabilities include â€¦

- **Shared Gateways** - They allow the sharing of load balancers and VIPs by
permitting independent Route resources to bind to the same Gateway. This allows
teams to share infrastructure safely without requiring direct coordination.  
- **Typed backend references** - With typed backend references Routes can
reference Kubernetes Services, but also any kind of Kubernetes resource that is
designed to be a Gateway backend.  
- **Cross-Namespace references** - Routes across different Namespaces can bind  
to Gateways. This allows for shared networking infrastructure despite Namespace  
segmentation for workloads.  
- **Classes** - GatewayClasses formalize types of load balancing implementations. 
These classes make it easy and explicit for users to understand what kind of
capabilities are available as a resource model itself.

### Where to get started

To get started, please read through [API overview](api-overview.md). These
documents give the necessary background to understand the API and the use-cases
it targets. Once you have a good understanding of the API at a higher-level,
please follow one of our [guides](guides.md) to dive deeper into different parts
of the API.

For a complete API reference, please refer to:

- [API reference](spec.md) 
- [Go docs for the package](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/service-apis/apis/v1alpha1)

### How to get involved

This project has many contributors and we welcome anybody and everybody to get
involved. Join our weekly meetings, file issues, or ask questions in Slack. No
contribution is too small - even opinions matter!
