# Kubernetes Service/Ingress API evolution

The Service APIs group is a part of the [Networking SIG][sn], and this repository is the home of the Kubernetes Service/Ingress API evolution work.

- The goal of this group is to flesh out and extend the original concepts in the [API sketch][apisketch] which was completed in September of 2019 by members of the sig-network group.
- [The primary documentation is available here in Github Pages][ghp], and is still heavily under development.
