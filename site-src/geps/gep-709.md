# GEP-709: Cross Namespace References from Routes

* Issue URL: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/709
* Status: Implementable

## TLDR

This GEP attempts to tackle both cross namespace forwarding and route inclusion.
These are closely related concepts that can be solved with a new ReferencePolicy
resource that enables app admins to describe where they trust references from.

## Motivation/User Journeys/Background

This GEP enables the following capabilities:

1. Retaining full control of Gateway and Routes in an infra namespace, while
   targeting apps in different namespaces.
1. Traffic splitting between Services in different namespaces.
1. Mesh overrides to target Services in different namespaces. 

## ReferencePolicy

Anytime we allow crossing a namespace boundary, we need to be very cautious. To
ensure that this feature is safe, we need to enforce a handshake mechanism that
requires resources in both namespaces to agree to this reference. To accomplish
that, a new ReferencePolicy resource should be introduced.

![Reference Policy](images/709-referencepolicy.png)

With this model, Routes would be able to directly reference Routes and Services
in other namespaces. These references would only be considered valid if a
ReferencePolicy in the target namespace explicitly allowed it. 

The following example shows how a HTTPRoute in namespace foo could reference
a Service in namespace bar. In this example a ReferencePolicy in the bar
namespace explicitly allows references to Services from HTTPRoutes in the foo
namespace.

```yaml
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: foo
spec:
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path: /bar
    forwardTo:
      backend:
      - name: bar
        namespace: bar
---
kind: ReferencePolicy
metadata:
  name: bar
  namespace: bar
spec:
  from:
  - group: networking.gateway.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    namespace: foo
  to:
  - group: core
    kind: Service
```

### API
This proposed API is fairly straightforward, but comes with a couple notable
decisions:

1. Each ReferencePolicy only supports a single From and To section. Additional
   trust relationships can be modeled with additional ReferencePolicy resources.
1. Resource names are intentionally excluded from this policy for simplicity and
   because they rarely provide any meaningful protection.
1. A single Namespace is allowed per "From" struct. Although a selector would be
   more powerful it may encourage unnecessarily insecure configuration.

```go
// ReferencePolicy identifies cross namespace relationships that are trusted for
// Gateway API.
type ReferencePolicy struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    // Spec defines the desired state of ReferencePolicy.
    Spec ReferencePolicySpec `json:"spec,omitempty"`
}


// ReferencePolicySpec identifies a cross namespace relationship that is trusted
// for Gateway API.
type ReferencePolicySpec struct {
    // From describes the trusted namespaces and kinds that can reference the
    // resources described in "To".
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinItems=1
    From []ReferencePolicyFrom `json:"from"`

    // To describes the resources that may be referenced by the resources
    // described in "From".
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinItems=1
    To []ReferencePolicyTo `json:"to"`
}

// ReferencePolicyFrom describes trusted namespaces and kinds.
type ReferencePolicyFrom struct {
    // Group is the group of the referrent.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Group string `json:"group"`

    // Kind is kind of the referrent.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Kind string `json:"kind"`

    // Namespace is the namespace of the referrent.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Namespace string `json:"namespace,omitempty"`
}

// ReferencePolicyTo describes trusted kinds.
type ReferencePolicyTo struct {
    // Group is the group of the referrent.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Group string `json:"group"`

    // Kind is kind of the referrent.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Kind string `json:"kind"`
}
```


### Benefits

* Conceptually similar to NetworkPolicy.
* A separate resource enables admins to restrict who can allow cross namespace
  references.
* Provides consistent way to control references to any resource from a Route.
* Can be extended in the future for additional use cases.
* A single ReferencePolicy resource can be used for a namespace in place of
  separate handshake config on each Service or Route resource.

#### Exceptions
If traffic is originating from the same location as the configured Route (such
as sidecars in some mesh implementations) implementations may choose to ignore
ReferencePolicy. This should only be done if:
* Other mechanisms like NetworkPolicy can be used to effectively limit
  cross-namespace references.
* The implementation clearly documents that ReferencePolicy is not honored.

This exception is very unlikely to apply to any ingress implementations of the
API and will not apply to all mesh implementations.

## ForwardTo

To enable cross-namespace forwarding, we'll need to add a `namespace` field to
the ForwardTo BackendRef struct.

```go
type BackendRef struct {
    // ...

    // Namespace is the namespace of the referrent.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Namespace string `json:"namespace,omitempty"`
}
```

## Alternatives

### Inline Config
Instead of ReferencePolicy, it is possible to represent these relationships
inline. 
![Inline](images/709-inline.png)

```yaml
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: foo
  namespace: foo
spec:
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path: /bar
    forwardTo:
      backend:
      - name: bar
        namespace: bar
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: baz
  namespace: baz
  annotations:
    gateway.networking.k8s.io/accept-forwarding-from: bar
```

Although this requires less YAML for the simple case, it is less flexible.
Annotations have real limitations and don't provide any room for RBAC
differentiation. Although it's possible that we could eventually add a proper
field to the Service API to represent this, it would be impossible to add this
concept to all potential backend types.

## Out of scope

* Although closely related, this GEP does not attempt to improve the
  Gateway->Route relationship. That will instead be covered by a future GEP.
* Although this GEP explores how ReferencePolicy could enable Route inclusion,
  the details of that feature will be left for a future GEP.
