# GEP-1426: HTTPRoute Mesh Binding

* Issue: [#1294](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1294)
* Status: Provisional

## Overview

Similar to how `HTTPRoutes` bind to `Gateways` and manage North/South traffic flows in Gateway APIâ€™s ingress use-case, it would be natural to adopt a similar model for traffic routing concerns in service mesh deployments. The purpose of this GEP is to add a mechanism to the Gateway API spec for the purpose of associating `HTTPRoutes` to a service mesh and offering a model for service owners to manage traffic splitting configurations.
	
This GEP is intended to establish an implementable, but experimental, baseline for supporting basic service mesh traffic routing functionality through the Gateway API spec.

## Personas

This GEP uses the [roles and personas](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/security-model/#roles-and-personas) defined in the Gateway API security model.

## Goals

* MUST allow `HTTPRoute` traffic rules to be configurable for a mesh service by the application owner/producer.
* SHOULD allow control by the cluster operator (mesh administrator) to grant permission for whether `HTTPRoute` resources in a given namespace are allowed to configure mesh traffic routing.
* SHOULD NOT require downstream "consumer" services to update configuration or DNS addresses for traffic to follow "producer" mesh routing rules configured by upstream services.
* SHOULD NOT require reconfiguring existing `HTTPRoute` resources for North/South Gateway configuration.

## Non-Goals

* Supporting "egress" use cases, which is currently a deferred goal, including:
    * Defining how "consumer" traffic rules which could override routing for service upstreams only within the local scope of a namespace or service might be configured.
    * Redirecting calls from arbitrary custom domains to an in-cluster service.
* Defining how multiple `Services` or `EndpointSlices` representing instances of a single "logical" service should present an identity for AuthN/AuthZ or be associated with each other beyond routing rules.
* Defining how AuthZ should be implemented to secure East/West traffic between services.
* Defining how [Policy Attachment](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/policy-attachment/) would bind to `HTTPRoute`, services or a mesh.
* Defining how `HTTPRoutes` configured for East/West service mesh traffic management might integrate with North/South `Gateways`.
    * This is a bit tricky in that it's effectively a form of delegation as described in [GEP-1058: Route Inclusion and Delegation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1085), and is planned to be explored in a future GEP.
* Handling East/West traffic outside the cluster (VMs, etc).

## Implementation Details and Constraints

* MUST set a status field on `HTTPRoute` to show if the routing configuration has been applied to the mesh.
* MUST only be allowed to configure "producer" traffic rules for a `Service` in the same namespace as the `HTTPRoute`.
    * Traffic routing configuration defined in this way SHOULD be respected by ALL consumer services in all namespaces in the mesh.
* SHOULD only be allowed to direct traffic to `backendRefs` within the same namespace when used for configuration of mesh traffic.
    * This constraint may be revisited in the future, but is intended to help simplify an initial implementation.
    * Attempting to specify an `HTTPBackendRef` in a different namespace should set a `ResolvedRefs` status condition with `status: "False"` and reason `RefNotPermitted` on the `HTTPRoute` if this is attempted.
    * When a route rule contains a `HTTPBackendRef` that is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for requests that would match that route rule.
        * This matches existing behavior as defined in [`HTTPRouteRule`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io%2fv1beta1.HTTPRouteRule).
* MAY assume that a mesh implements "transparent proxy" functionality to redirect calls to the Kubernetes DNS address for a `Service` through mesh routing rules.

## Introduction

It is proposed that an application owner should configure traffic rules for a mesh service by configuring an `HTTPRoute` with a Kubernetes `Service` resource as a `parentRef`.

This approach is dependent on both the "frontend" role of the Kubernetes `Service` resource as defined in [GEP-1324: Service Mesh in Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1324/#service) when used as a `parentRef` and the "backend" role of `Service` when used as a `backendRef`. It would use the Kubernetes service name to match traffic for meshes implementing "transparent proxy" functionality, but the `backendRef` endpoints would ultimately be used for the canonical IP address(es) to which traffic should be redirected by rules defined in this HTTPRoute. This approach leverages the existing points of extensibility within the Gateway API spec, and would not require introducing any API changes or new resources, only defining expected behavior.

## API

```
metadata:
  name: foo_route
  namespace: store
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: Service
    name: foo
  rules:
    backendRefs:
    - kind: Service
      name: foo
      weight: 90
    - kind: Service
      name: foo_v2
      weight: 10
```

In the example above, routing rules have been configured to direct 90% of traffic for the `foo` `Service` to the default "backend" endpoints specified by the `foo` `Service` [`selector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service) field, and 10% to the `foo_v2` `Service`. This is determined based on the `ClusterIP` (for `Service`) and `ClusterSetIP` (for `ServiceImport`) matching, and for "transparent proxy" mesh implementations would match all requests to `foo.svc.cluster.local` (or arbitrary custom suffix, as the hostname is not specified manually) from within the same namespace, all requests to `foo.store.svc.cluster.local` from other namespaces, and all requests to `foo.store.svc.clusterset.local` for multicluster services, within the scope of the service mesh.

### Omitting `backendRefs`

Implementations SHOULD support a terse syntax which allows omitting `backendRefs` to avoid unnecessary redundancy for simple configurations. If no `backendRefs` are specified, implementations should direct traffic to the default endpoints of the `parentRef` `Service`. If the `parentRef` does not have any endpoints (e.g. if it is a `Service` without selectors), implementations MUST return an HTTP 503 response code (see discussion in [#1210](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1210)).

This syntax has limited utility currently, but could become more relevant if additional functionality beyond traffic splitting is added to the `HTTPRoute` resource. `HTTPRoutes` configured in this way MAY be used to manually enroll services into a mesh (which could trigger behavior like injecting a sidecar proxy) if they have not already been enrolled by some other mechanism (as proposed in [GEP-1291: Mesh Representation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyA9uUH7pNNxxwy3WZGSWx-edHDBLrujcezr8q3el70/edit) or similar).

```
metadata:
  name: foo_route
  namespace: store
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: Service
    name: foo
  rules:
    matches:
    - path:
        value: "/bar"
```

The example above would drop all incoming traffic for HTTP paths other than `/bar` to the `foo` `Service`, following the existing spec to return HTTP 404 response codes for unmatched requests, and HTTP 500 response codes for requests excluded due to an [`HTTPRouteFilter`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.HTTPRouteFilter).

### Allowed service types

Services valid to be selected as a `parentRef` SHOULD have a way to identify traffic to them - typically by one or more virtual IP(s), DNS hostname(s) or name(s).

Implementations SHOULD support the default [`ClusterIP`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) `Service` type as a `parentRef`, with or without selectors.

["Headless" `Services`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) SHOULD NOT be supported as a `parentRef`, because they do not implement the "frontend" functionality of a service.

`Service` resource with [`type: NodePort`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport) or [`type: LoadBalancer`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) MAY be allowed as `parentRefs` or `backendRefs`, as these do provision virtual IPs and are effectively `ClusterIP` services with additional functionality, but it should typically be preferred to expose services publicly through the North/South Gateway API interfaces instead.

`Service` resources with [`type: ExternalName`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname) SHOULD NOT be allowed as `parentRefs` or `backendRefs` due to [security concerns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/103675), although might eventually play some role in [configuring egress functionality](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1070).

Services supported as `backendRefs` SHOULD be consistent with expectations for North/South Gateway API implementations, and MUST have associated endpoints. `ClusterIP` `Services` with selectors SHOULD be supported as a `backendRef`.

#### `Service` without selectors

An alternate pattern additionally supported by this approach would be to target a `Service` without selectors as the `parentRef`. This could be a clean way to create a pure routing construct and abstract a logical frontend, as traffic would resolve to a `backendRef` `Service` with selectors defined on the `HTTPRoute`, or receive a 4xx/5xx error response if no matching path or valid backend was found.


#### Multicluster support with `ServiceImport`

`ServiceImport` resources allocate a virtual IP in the cluster, so MAY be allowed as a `parentRef`.

`ServiceImport` would remain a valid backend option for `HTTPRoute` resources (but _not_ currently a requirement for core conformance), and could be specified alongside a `Service` `backendRef` to split traffic across clusters within a `ClusterSet` (as defined in the [Multi-cluster Service (MCS) APIs project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mcs-api)). This could be a way to solve the need described in [A use case for using Gateway APIs in Multi-Cluster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bjr0uAVMmEtTX4mpU_aGXXapQFsEz_Qt0OnDoVswEEI/edit).

### `hostnames` field

GAMMA implementations SHOULD NOT infer any functionality from the `hostnames` field on `HTTPRoute` due to current under-specification and reserved potential for future usage or API changes. For the use case of filtering incoming traffic from selected hostnames, it is recommended to guide users toward configuring [`HTTPHeaderMatch`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io%2fv1beta1.HTTPHeaderMatch) rules for the [`Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host) header. Functionality to be explored in future GEPs may include supporting concurrent usage of an `HTTPRoute` traffic configuration for multiple North/South `Gateways` and East/West mesh use cases or redirection of egress traffic to an in-cluster `Service`.

### Limiting graph depth, preventing conflicts and cycles

A `Service` may only be specified as a `parentRef` of an `HTTPRoute` if it is:

* NOT already specified as a `parentRef` of another `HTTPRoute` [in the same namespace]
    * This requirement may be relaxed later to follow the existing [precedence rules](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io%2fv1beta1.HTTPRouteRule), but is intended to simplify initial implementation.
    * The namespace colocation requirement effectively forecloses using this strategy to delegate route management, but there is service mesh [user interest](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/22997) in merging separately-defined routes together to manage large configurations, multiple versions or canary deployments for a single mesh service.
* NOT already specified as a `backendRef` of any _other_ `HTTPRoute` with a `Service` `parentRef`
    * A `Service` MAY still be listed as a `backendRef` on the _same_ `HTTPRoute` where it is specified as a `parentRef`, e.g. to only split off some subset of traffic from the default backend endpoints.
    * This could be computationally expensive to validate.

This should be enforced by controller validation, which should set an `Accepted: { status: False }` condition with a corresponding new `ParentRefConflict` `RouteConditionReason`.

The logic described here is a bit verbose, but could be validated with conformance tests, and is intended to allow an `HTTPRoute` configuring mesh traffic rules to additionally specify a `Gateway` `parentRef` (or `HTTPRoute` `parentRef` if [GEP-1058: Route Inclusion and Delegation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1085) moves forward) to apply the same routing rules when exposing a mesh service outside the cluster.

### Drawbacks

* The fact that this pattern is used for mesh configuration is implicit - this may benefit from some additional configuration to map the `HTTPRoute` to a particular mesh implementation rather than being picked up by any or all GAMMA meshes present in a cluster. Possible approaches include:
* [GEP-1282: Describing Backend Properties](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1282/) may be one path to associating a `Service` with a mesh, but likely wouldn't be able to handle the application of multiple `HTTPRoutes` for the same `Service`, but each intended for different mesh implementations
    * It's currently unclear how relevant this constraint may be, but associating an `HTTPRoute` with a mesh by this method would additionally require an extra graph traversal step.
* Expecting a `Mesh` `parentRef` or similar reference as proposed in [GEP-1291: Mesh Representation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyA9uUH7pNNxxwy3WZGSWx-edHDBLrujcezr8q3el70/edit#) may be a preferred eventual path forward, but wouldn't be required initially, with the assumption that only one mesh should typically be present in a cluster.
* No mechanism for egress redirection of traffic from arbitrary hostnames to a mesh service within this approach (but could still be implemented seperately).

## Alternatives

### New `MeshService` (or `HttpService`, `VirtualService`, `ServiceBinding`) resource as `parentRef`

Introduce a new resource to represent the "frontend" role of a service as defined in [GEP-1291: Mesh Representation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyA9uUH7pNNxxwy3WZGSWx-edHDBLrujcezr8q3el70/edit#).

#### Controller manages new DNS hostname

A controller could create a matching selector-less `Service` (i.e. no endpoints), to create a `.cluster.local` name, or could interact with [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) to create a DNS name in an owned domain.

Ownership/trust would remain based on naming pattern: `serviceName.namespace.svc.[USER_DOMAIN]`

Separate `HttpService`, `TlsService` and `TcpService` resources could have the benefit of allowing us to define protocol specific elements to the spec along with an embedded `CommonServiceSpec`, similar to [`CommonRouteSpec`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.CommonRouteSpec), and keep similar patterns as `Service`.

##### Drawbacks

* May require reconfiguring existing applications to point to a new mesh service hostname - adoption wouldn't be "transparent".
* The pattern of creating a new pure routing construct would still be implementable following the proposed approach, by manually creating and targeting a new `Service` without selectors as a `parentRef`, without the overhead of introducing a new resource.

#### Manage DNS by binding to an existing `Service`

A new `ServiceBinding` resource would directly reference an existing `Service` to determine which traffic should be intercepted and redirected following configured service mesh routing rules and facilitate "transparent proxy" functionality. This resource could possibly share similar responsibilites as the need identified in [GEP-1282: Describing Backend Properties](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1282/).

```
kind: ServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: foo_binding
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: Service
    name: foo
---
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: ServiceBinding
    name: foo_binding
  rules:
    backendRefs:
    - kind: Service
      name: foo
      weight: 90
    - kind: Service
      name: foo_v2
      weight: 10
```

While the `HTTPRoute` does not directly reference a particular mesh implementation in this approach, it would be possible to design the `ServiceBinding` resource to specify that.

##### Drawbacks

* Introduces an extra layer of abstraction while still having several of the same fundamental drawbacks as a direct `parentRef` binding to `Service`.
* May require reconfiguring `Gateway` `HTTPRoutes` to specify `ServiceBindings` as `backendRefs`.

#### Drawbacks

* The split frontend/backend role of `Service` is fundamentally an issue with the `Service` resource, and while upstream changes may be quite slow, this would likely be best addressed through an upstream KEP - introducing a new resource to GAMMA now would likely result in API churn if we expect a similar proposal to be upstreamed eventually.
* Adopting the proposed `Service` as `parentRef` approach wouldn't foreclose the possibility of migrating to a new frontend-only resource in the future, and wouldn't even require a breaking change to `HTTPRoute`, just adding support for a new `parentRef` `Kind`.
* Would be less clear how to integrate with transparent proxy functionality - it may be possible to design some way to select a `Service` or hostname to intercept, but abstraction through a seprate resource would make configuration more complex.

### `Mesh` resource as `parentRef`

This binds an `HTTPRoute` directly to a cluster-scoped `Mesh` object as defined in [GEP-1291: Mesh Representation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyA9uUH7pNNxxwy3WZGSWx-edHDBLrujcezr8q3el70/edit#).

```
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: Mesh
    name: cool-mesh
```

It is currently undefined how this approach may interact with either explicitly configured [`hostnames`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.HTTPRouteSpec) or implicit "transparent proxy" routing for Kubernetes `Services` to determine how traffic should be intercepted and redirected.

This approach is not entirely abandoned, as it could supplement the proposed approach if explicit attachment to a specific mesh is deemed necessary. Additionally, this approach may offer a future option for attaching an `HTTPRoute` to a mesh, but not a specific service (e.g. to implement mesh-wide egress functionality for all requests to a specific hostname).

#### Peer to `Service` resource `parentRef`

An `HTTPRoute` could specify a `Mesh` resource `parentRef` as a peer to a `Service` resource `parentRef`.

```
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: Mesh
    name: cool-mesh
  - kind: Service
    name: foo
```

##### Drawbacks

* Would require separate `HTTPRoute` resources to explicitly define _different_ traffic routing rules for the same service on different meshes.

#### Nested `services` and `hostnames` fields in [`ParentReference`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.ParentReference)

In core conformance, the `services` would only be valid for `Mesh` types, and `hostnames` field only for `Gateway`. Mesh implementations could still use a `Host` header match if they wanted limit rules to specific hostnames.

```
parentRefs:
- kind: Mesh
  name: coolmesh
  services:
  - name: foo
    kind: Service
- kind: Gateway
  name: staging
  hostnames: [staging.example.com]
- kind: Gateway
  name: prod
  hostnames: [prod.example.com]
# Top level hostnames field removed
```

Moving the `hostnames` field from `HTTPRoute` to `ParentReference` might introduce a clean path for concurrently using a route across North/South and mesh use cases,  even without introducing the `services` field or a new `Mesh` resource, and even makes pure North/South implementations more flexible by allowing a hostname-per-`Gateway` scope.

##### Drawbacks

* Substantial API change, impacting even North/South use cases
* Extending this functionality to support mesh-wide egress or arbitrary redirection may still require some sort of bidirectional handshake with a `Hostname` resource to support configuration across namespaces and limit conflicting configuration.


#### Phantom `parentRef`
```
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: Mesh
    name: istio
```

This is done by configuring the `parentRef`, to point to the `istio` `Mesh`. This resource does not actually exist in the cluster and is only used to signal that the Istio mesh should be used. In Istio's [experimental implementation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/#mesh-traffic), the `hostnames` field on `HTTPRoute` is used to match mesh service traffic to the routing rules.

### New field on `HTTPRoute` for `Service` binding

A new field `serviceBinding` would be added to `HTTPRoute` to attach to the `Service`. Alternatively, this could be a new field in [`HTTPRouteMatch`](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.HTTPRouteMatch). As with the proposed implementation, this approach could be combined with a `Mesh` resource or similar as the `parentRef`, which would just define that the route would be applied to a mesh. 

```
spec:
  serviceBinding:
    name: my-service
```

OR

```
spec:
  matches:
    service:
      name: my-service
```

For either implementation, the type of the `serviceBinding` or `service` field should likely be a struct with `Group` (defaulting to the Kubernetes core API group when unspecified), `Kind` (defaulting to `Service` when unspecified) and `Name` fields, to allow for extensibility to `ServiceImport` or custom mesh service types.

#### Drawbacks

* API addition required, which is somewhat awkwardly ignored for North/South use cases, and could complicate potential for concurrent use of an `HTTPRoute` across both North/South and mesh use cases.
* Adding new fields to a relatively stable resource like `HTTPRoute` could be difficult to do in an experimental way.
* Following this pattern may lead to subsequent additional fields to further clarify or extend behavior.

### `Gateway` resource with `class: mesh` as `parentRef`

To support arbitrary DNS names (owned by a "domain owner persona") we would need a similar mechanism to what `Gateway` is using for delegating management of `HTTPRoutes` to namespaces. Instead of duplicating everything - we could use `Gateway` as is, with `class: mesh` (or matching the mesh implementation desired name).

```
kind: Gateway
spec:
  class: mesh
  listeners:
  - name: example
    hostname: "example.com"
---
kind: HTTPRoute
spec:
  parentRefs:
    name: foo_gateway
    sectionName: example
  hostnames: ["example.com", "foo.svc.cluster.local"]
```

Functionally such a mesh could be implemented using the existing gateway spec - a GAMMA implementation would only remove the extra hop through the `Gateway`, using sidecars, or it may use a specialized per-namespace gateway to isolate the mesh traffic (like [Istio Ambient](https://istio.io/latest/blog/2022/introducing-ambient-mesh/)). Proxyless gRPC could also use this to route directly.

This solution could work well for both non-`cluster.local` names but also for egress, where a `Gateway` with `class: egress` could define names that are external to the mesh and need to either have policies applied or go to a dedicated egress gateway. 

#### Drawbacks

* Using the `HTTPRoute` `hostnames` field to match mesh traffic breaks from the typical Gateway API pattern of explicit Kubernetes resource references, is extremely implicit, and could reduce portability of configuration.
* Potentially unclear translation between conceptual resource and concrete implementation, particularly for "proxyless" mesh implementations.
* Service meshes may wish to express [egress](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/egress/egress-gateway/) or [other "in-mesh" gateways](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/gateways) through an API like this, and it could be confusing to overload this resource too much or conflate different personas who may wish to manage mesh service traffic routing as an application owner separately from egress rules as a service consumer or cluster operator.

### `ServiceProjection` resource as `parentRef` and `backendRefs`

This approach is similar to the above `ServiceBinding` proposal with a couple of major differences:

* `ServiceProjection` encapsulates both "frontend" and "backend" roles of the `Service` resource
* `ServiceProjection` could handle the full responsibilities described in [GEP-1282: Describing Backend Properties](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1282/)

```
kind: ServiceProjection
metadata:
    name: foo
    namespace: store
spec:
    serviceRef:
        name: foo
        kind: Service|ServiceImport
    roles:
        frontend:
       backend:
            loadbalancerConfig:
                strategy: RoundRobin
             clientTLS:
                secretRef:
                    ...
---
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: foo_route
  namespace: store
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - kind: ServiceProjection
    name: foo
    role: frontend
  rules:
    backendRefs:
    - kind: ServiceProjection
      name: foo
      role: backend
      weight: 90
    - kind: ServiceProjection
      role: backend
      name: foo_v2
      weight: 10
```

For convenience, `ServiceProjection` could have a `meshRef` field that, when set instead of `serviceRef`, makes all configuration within the `ServiceProjection` apply to all services in the mesh (the mesh control plane would need to read the `Mesh` resource). Pursuant to the changes to status semantics in [GEP-1364: Status and Conditions Update](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1364/), it is necessary for the route to attach to something; in this case, the route attaches to the specific role or profile of the `ServiceProjection` and the mesh control plane should update the route status to reflect that.

#### Drawbacks

* May require reconfiguring `Gateway` `HTTPRoutes` to specify `ServiceProjections` as `backendRefs`.
* Verbose boilerplate for each service.
