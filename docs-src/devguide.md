# Building, testing and deploying

You will need to have Docker installed to perform the steps below.

## Project management

We are using the Github issues and project dashboard to manage the list of TODOs
for this project:

* [Open issues][gh-issues]
* [Project dashboard][gh-dashboard]

[gh-issues]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis/issues
[gh-dashboard]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis/projects/1

Issues labeled `good first issue` and `help wanted` are especially good for a
first contribution.

## Release cadence

During the development phase, we expect to release on a monthly cadence. We are
explicitly decoupling ourselves from the Kubernetes API versioning cycle to
give us more flexibility to evolve the specification. As the specification solidifies,
we will slow down our release cycle.

General target timeline:

* 1H 2020: Monthly release cycle, with first release targeted for January 31
* 2H 2020: Slower release cycle

## Building the code

The project uses `make` to drive the build. You can kick off an overall build
from the top-level makefile:

```shell
make
```

## Testing the code

The easiest way to test the code is to use the [kubebuilder][kubebuilder]
created CRD with a [kind][kind] cluster. Follow the installation instructions
for `kind` in the README in the repo.

```shell
kind create cluster
...
# Install the CRDs
make install

# Remove the CRDs and associated CRs
make uninstall
```

[kind]: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind

## Submitting a review

TODO

### Verify

Make sure you run the static analysis over the repo before submitting your
changes. The [Prow presubmit][prow-setup] will not let your change merge if
verification fails.

```shell
make verify
```

[prow-setup]: https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/config/jobs/kubernetes-sigs/service-apis

## Documentation

The site documentation is written in [mkdocs][mkdocs] format. The files are
contained in `docs-src/`. Generated files are in `docs/` and published to
Github Pages.

Building the docs:

```shell
make docs
```

Live preview for editing (view on [http://localhost:8000](), CTRL-C to quit):

```shell
make serve
```

### Publishing

The docs are published automatically to [Github pages][ghp]. When making changes to the
documentation, generate the new documentation and make the generated code a
self-contained commit (e.g. the changes to `docs/`). This will keep the code
reviews simple and clearly delineate user vs generated content.

[mkdocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org/
